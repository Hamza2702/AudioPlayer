# AudioPlayer
Due to my most recent hobby, CD collecting, I've gone out of the way to try and create a real time CD scrobbler.

Currently, using AudioPlayer, you can -
- Search for artists
- Check for a song with your default mic input and identify that song

To do -
- Polish design
- Optimise search feature (dropdown?)
- Dropdown menu for device input (ease of access)
- Play the current song on the user's spotify application (to record a scrobble)
