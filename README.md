# AudioPlayer
Due to my most recent hobby, CD collecting, I've gone out of the way to try and create a real time CD scrobbler.

Currently, using AudioPlayer, you can -
- Search for artists
- Use the dropdown menu (or keep your default device) to identify a song!
- Display of Artist/Album Image cover
- Connect to Spotify
- Sync and play on Spotify
- 5 most recent tracks are saved and are linked to their Spotify page through clicking!

To do -
- Polish design
- Play entire album (starting from the identified song)
- Add PC audio
- Bug fixes
- Testing
